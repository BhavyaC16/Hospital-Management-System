# Hospital-Management-System
A basic Hospital Management System, based on C++
A Hospital Management System mainly focuses on the administrative needs of hospitals. It is designed to manage various aspects of a hospital's operation, such as:
• Record of Patients,
• Registration of New Patients,
• Admission/Discharge of Patients,
• Bed Count,
• Bill Generation, 
and many other processing operations and services.

Hospital Management Systems provide different health care organizations and professionals a common source of information about a patient’s health record, thereby enabling them to visit the patient's health history whenever and wherever required.

These Systems largely enhance information integrity and reduce transcription errors and duplication of information entries. Hospital Management Systems must be easy to use and eliminate errors caused by handwriting.
